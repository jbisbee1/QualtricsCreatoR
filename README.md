# QualtricsCreatoR

Quickly create large Qualtrics surveys in R.

This R package contains a single function that takes a survey formatted as a list of questions and choices and transforms it into a Qualtrics-formatted .txt file, ready for importing. It is based on a blog post by Sean Murphy which can be found at https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/.

With ```devtools```, install the package from github using ```install_github('jbisbee1/QualtricsCreatoR')```

For more information on Qualtrics .txt formatting, see https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/.
